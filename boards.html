     The board has a new old school ride. It is larger than the penny boards, but shorter than old school shapes.
     The concave will vary from each shape, but there is about 3/8in drop in center of the deck.

    <p>
      Each board comes with a clear spray on grip that has enough hold with less wear and tear on the shoes compared to standard grip tape. 
      Message me if you prefer a raw board to add your own grip.
