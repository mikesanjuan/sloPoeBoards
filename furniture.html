          Reclaimed pallet wine rack. Holds up to 10 wine bottles and 9 glasses. 
        </p>
        <p>
          Each rack is made to order. Will vary in wood grain and slightly in size.
          I use many variable pallets from poplar, pine, oak, and other wood from reclaimed pallets. 
          Roughly sanded then finished to keep the rustic appeal. Pulled out as many nails possible and use screws to reassemble.
        <p>
        Dimensions: 12"tall 16"wide and roughly 5" total depth. Pre drilled countersink holes to mount to wall.
